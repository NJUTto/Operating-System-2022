- a. Verify that the Available array has been calculated correctly.
- b. Calculate the Need matrix.
- c. Show that the current state is safe, that is, show a safe sequence of processes. In addition, to the sequence show how the Available (working array) changes as each process terminates.
- d. Given the request (3,2,3,3) from Process P5. Should this request be granted? Why or why not?

**6.11** Consider a system with a total of 150 units of memory, allocated to three processes as shown:
